We all know the plight of migrant labourers post-COVID-19.
A lot of the daily-wage-workers rushed to their homes in villages when the lockdown was instated. Now that these restrictions are being lifted, it's a real challenge for them to find employment. A lot of old businesses have been shut down and many others are running at a reduced capacity. Workers can use their simple 2G Feature Phones to register themselves on a nationwide database of workers actively seeking for employment by just sending a message.

The message will be sent to a toll free number in the following format:

```
<pin-code> <skill-code>
```

Here pin-code is the pin code of the location the worker wants to find employment in and skill-code represents the following skills:
<table>
  <tr>
    <th>Skill Code</th>
    <th>Skill</th>
  </tr>

  <tr>
    <td>
      1
    </td>
    <td>
      driver
    </td>
  </tr> 
    <tr>
      <td>
        2
      </td>
      <td>
        labourer
      </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>
        3
      </td>
      <td>
        maid
      </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>
        4
      </td>
      <td>
        guard
      </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>
        5
      </td>
      <td>
        carpenter
      </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>
        6
      </td>
      <td>
         plumber
      </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>
        7
      </td>
      <td>
        electrician
      </td>
    </tr>
</table>

This adds the worker to the worker database and automatically finds the district of the worker like this:

<br />
Now the worker will be listed in the Rozgar app for being hired by a potential employer. 

## For  Employers

Employers have been hit really hard by a shortage of both skilled and unskilled workers. These employers can use our app to provide the pin code of their home or workplace and their requirement(maid, labourer) etc. to search for relevant workers near them. The employers can then contact these workers and hire them. So there's a win-win situation for both the hiring and the hired.
