We all know the plight of migrant labourers post-COVID-19.
A lot of the daily-wage-workers rushed to their homes in villages when the lockdown was instated. Now that these restrictions are being lifted, it's a real challenge for them to find employment. A lot of old businesses have been shut down and many others are running at a reduced capacity. Workers can use their simple 2G Feature Phones to register themselves on a nationwide database of workers actively seeking for employment by just sending a message.

The message will be sent to a toll free number in the following format:

```
<pin-code> <skill-code>
```

Here pin-code is the pin code of the location the worker wants to find employment in and skill-code represents the following skills:
<table>
